						<h2>Traveling</h2>
						<p>
						Since a young age, I’ve had the privilege to travel all around the globe with my family, and thanks to it, I’ve developed a passion for exploring new countries and cultures which I’ve brought to university. I joined and am now Vice President of a travel association and my goal is to share my love for travelling through the association. Things such as trying out new food, learning new words and phrases, and meeting new people are the reasons why I love travelling.

						<h2>Tennis</h2>
						<p>
						I’ve also always had a passion for Tennis. Coming from Switzerland, there’s always been a massive Tennis culture mainly thanks to Roger Federer, who was my idol my whole childhood. I love to stay active and play sports and the sport that stuck with me through the years has been Tennis. It’s also been my way of connecting with my father as he also shares the same passion as me.

						<h2>Chess</h2>
						<p>
							Since the start of highschool, I’ve enjoyed playing chess on a regular basis. The intricate and complex game has motivated me to keep improving and researching new openings, and midge and endgame theory. With the help of the internet, its very simply to sit down and watch a video about a certain opening and applying it online to see it in action.
